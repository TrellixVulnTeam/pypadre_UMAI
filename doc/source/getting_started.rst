Getting Started - First Steps with PyPadre
==========================================

Installation
------------
Python Requirements
- Python 3.7
Installation of the PyPaDRe client is then done by simply installing the pip package
pip install pypadre


Configuration
-------------
When PaDRe is executed, a default configuration file is created in your home directory and in the current scenario the
user does not have to add anything else. This config file can then be updated by the user with different configurations
such as a GitHub token for logging the experiments to GitHub, a Database username and password for storing the
experiments in a Database, or even the locations of datasets. The base config would usually contain whether PaDRe is
offline and the root directory of PaDRe.
